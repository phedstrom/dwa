	<h1>Scale Drawing Dimension Calculator</h1>
	<h3>Hedstrom P3: Javascript Tool Proposal</h3>

	<p>From time to time, I need to take the dimensions of a building or garden and draft them into a plan. If measurements are taken using the metric system, it is fairly easy to render them onto a page by simple <a href="http://westone.wa.gov.au/toolbox8/furniture/toolbox/shared/resources_dr/techniques/conventions/scale.htm">calculations</a> - but they never are. 
	Measurements in the US are taken in inches and feet, which can be more challenging to convert. Scale rulers are handy to use and a standard draftsman's tool, but they cause headaches when you have to interpolate a point somewhere in between the marks on the edge.</p>

	<p>It would be super useful to be able to input a measurement in inches and feet, have a calculator convert that dimension to millimeters, convert those millimeters again at the desired scale (1:50 or 1:1/4 for example), so it could be accurately drawn with a metric ruler. No special equipment required. I could take that information and just draw the line. Presto!
	</p>

	<p>Using the <a href="http://students.susanbuck.net/storage/projects/javascript-tools/programmersBestFriend_BenChirlin/compsciFriend/">example</a> suggested in the assignment, I hope to develop a calculator that has better graphics and will make drafting less of a chore.
