	<h1>A Perfect Day Travel Forum</h1>
	<h3>Hedstrom P4: Final Project</h3>

	<p>A crowd sourced web-site allowing users to post, read and comment on activity and travel ideas. The "days" could be geographically or topically based (e.g. for children, couples, indoors, outdoors). A perfect day travel will be the place where users search for information by particular keywords or browse the topics for inspiration.</p>

	<p>Chowhound is a well developed model for what I have in mind. The forum is constantly updated and has expanded from restaurant suggestions to encompass topics of interest to 'foodies' in general.  It's <a href="http://www.chow.com/about"><evolution</a> has been highly commercial, but the heart of the site is still the fresh, insightful, really local input of its members.</p>

	<p>Obviously, I'm not the first person to think of this. Plenty of sites already exist for travel planning:
	</p>
	insert trip advisor and independent traveler here. - my site would be a place for local insight to benefit a wider audience. Beyond the tourist trade, suggestions for the most wonderful days - wherever you may find yourself. Slow travel if you will.
	<h3>Features I will strive to incorporate - time willing - because I want to know how to do them</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Rank ordered list of most viewed posts;</li>
		<li>User avatars;</li>
		<li>jQuery UI based header with rotating photos;</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Extra features that could be incorporated some day but are probably beyond the scope of this project:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Rank ordered list of most viewed posts;</li>
		<li>A user page for organizing all the links from the forum and other sites into a travel planner;</li>
		<li>Regional maps on posts with pins on </li>
	</ul>
